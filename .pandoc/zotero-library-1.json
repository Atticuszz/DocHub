Besides point-wise operations, the ikd-Tree supports several features such as box-wise operations and down-sampling that are practically useful in robotic applications. In parallel to the incremental operations (i.e., insert, re-insert, and delete), ikd-Tree actively monitors the tree structure and partially re-balances the tree, which enables efficient nearest point search in later stages. The ikd-Tree is carefully engineered and supports multi-thread parallel computing to maximize the overall efficiency. We validate the ikd-Tree in both theory and practical experiments. On theory level, a complete time complexity analysis is presented to prove the high efficiency. On experiment level, the ikd-Tree is tested on both randomized datasets and real-world LiDAR point data in LiDAR-inertial odometry and mapping application. In all tests, ikd-Tree consumes only 4% of the running time in a static k-d tree.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cai","given":"Yixi"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Fu"}],"citation-key":"caiIkdTreeIncrementalKD2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2102.10808","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,22]]},"number":"arXiv:2102.10808","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"ikd-Tree: An Incremental K-D Tree for Robotic Applications","title-short":"ikd-Tree","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10808"},{"id":"choiIterativeKclosestPoint2020","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Choi","given":"Ouk"},{"family":"Park","given":"Min-Gyu"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Youngbae"}],"citation-key":"choiIterativeKclosestPoint2020","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s20185331","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"5331","publisher":"MDPI","source":"Google Scholar","title":"Iterative K-closest point algorithms for colored point cloud registration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/18/5331","volume":"20"},{"id":"fanInstantSplatUnboundedSparseview2024","type":"article","abstract":"While novel view synthesis (NVS) from a sparse set of images has advanced significantly in 3D computer vision, it relies on precise initial estimation of camera parameters using Structure-from-Motion (SfM). For instance, the recently developed Gaussian Splatting depends heavily on the accuracy of SfM-derived points and poses. However, SfM processes are time-consuming and often prove unreliable in sparse-view scenarios, where matched features are scarce, leading to accumulated errors and limited generalization capability across datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel and efficient framework to enhance robust NVS from sparse-view images. Our framework, InstantSplat, integrates multi-view stereo(MVS) predictions with point-based representations to construct 3D Gaussians of large-scale scenes from sparse-view data within seconds, addressing the aforementioned performance and efficiency issues by SfM. Specifically, InstantSplat generates densely populated surface points across all training views and determines the initial camera parameters using pixel-alignment. Nonetheless, the MVS points are not globally accurate, and the pixel-wise prediction from all views results in an excessive Gaussian number, yielding a overparameterized scene representation that compromises both training speed and accuracy. To address this issue, we employ a grid-based, confidence-aware Farthest Point Sampling to strategically position point primitives at representative locations in parallel. Next, we enhance pose accuracy and tune scene parameters through a gradient-based joint optimization framework from self-supervision. By employing this simplified framework, InstantSplat achieves a substantial reduction in training time, from hours to mere seconds, and demonstrates robust performance across various numbers of views in diverse datasets.","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2403.20309","note":"arXiv:2403.20309 [cs]","number":"arXiv:2403.20309","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"InstantSplat: Unbounded Sparse-view Pose-free Gaussian Splatting in 40 Seconds","title-short":"InstantSplat","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20309","author":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Zhiwen"},{"family":"Cong","given":"Wenyan"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Kairun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Xinghao"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Danfei"},{"family":"Ivanovic","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Pavone","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Pavlakos","given":"Georgios"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhangyang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yue"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"citation-key":"fanInstantSplatUnboundedSparseview2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"fanInstantSplatUnboundedSparseview2024"},{"id":"guptaNDT6DColor2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            Registration of point cloud data containing both depth and color information is critical for a variety of applications, including in‐field robotic plant manipulation, crop growth modeling, and autonomous navigation. However, current state‐of‐the‐art registration methods often fail in challenging agricultural field conditions due to factors such as occlusions, plant density, and variable illumination. To address these issues, we propose the NDT‐6D registration method, which is a color‐based variation of the Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) registration approach for point clouds. Our method computes correspondences between pointclouds using both geometric and color information and minimizes the distance between these correspondences using only the three‐dimensional (3D) geometric dimensions. We evaluate the method using the GRAPES3D data set collected with a commercial‐grade RGB‐D sensor mounted on a mobile platform in a vineyard. Results show that registration methods that only rely on depth information fail to provide quality registration for the tested data set. The proposed color‐based variation outperforms state‐of‐the‐art methods with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1–1.6 cm for NDT‐6D compared with 1.1–2.3 cm for other color‐information‐based methods and 1.2–13.7 cm for noncolor‐information‐based methods. The proposed method is shown to be robust against noises using the TUM RGBD data set by artificially adding noise present in an outdoor scenario. The relative pose error (RPE) increased 14% for our method compared to an increase of 75% for the best‐performing registration method. The obtained average accuracy suggests that the NDT‐6D registration methods can be used for in‐field precision agriculture applications, for example, crop detection, size‐based maturity estimation, and growth modeling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Gupta","given":"Himanshu"},{"family":"Lilienthal","given":"Achim J."},{"family":"Andreasson","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Kurtser","given":"Polina"}],"citation-key":"guptaNDT6DColor2023","container-title":"Journal of Field Robotics","container-title-short":"Journal of Field Robotics","DOI":"10.1002/rob.22194","ISSN":"1556-4959, 1556-4967","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1603-1619","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"NDT‐6D for color registration in agri‐robotic applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rob.22194","volume":"40"},{"id":"hanPCKRFPointCloud2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Yiheng"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Irvin Haozhe"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Long"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yu-Ping"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Minjing"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Matthieu Gaetan"},{"family":"Sheng","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yong-Jin"}],"citation-key":"hanPCKRFPointCloud2024","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","DOI":"10.1109/TVCG.2024.3390122","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"publisher":"IEEE","source":"Google Scholar","title":"PCKRF: Point Cloud Completion and Keypoint Refinement With Fusion Data for 6D Pose Estimation","title-short":"PCKRF","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10504632/"},{"id":"hanPointCloudRegistration2024","author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Tianyu"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ruijie"},{"family":"Kan","given":"Jiangming"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Ruifang"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xixuan"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Shun"}],"citation-key":"hanPointCloudRegistration2024","container-title":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs16050743","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"page":"743","publisher":"MDPI","source":"Google Scholar","title":"A Point Cloud Registration Framework with Color Information Integration","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},{"id":"haoRobustPointCloud2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hao","given":"Ruidong"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Zhongwei"},{"family":"He","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Kaifeng"},{"family":"He","given":"Jiawei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Muyu"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Zhuang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xin"}],"citation-key":"haoRobustPointCloud2023","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s23249837","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"9837","publisher":"MDPI","source":"Google Scholar","title":"Robust Point Cloud Registration Network for Complex Conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/24/9837","volume":"23"},{"id":"haRGBDGSICPSLAM2024","type":"article","abstract":"Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with dense representation plays a key role in robotics, Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) applications.

GICP-based 3D point cloud registration between consecutive frames and consecutive key frames is first combined to optimize laser odometer constraints without other sensors such as inertial measurement unit (IMU). According to the characteristics of the roadway, the innovative extraction of the roadway plane as the node constraint of pose graph SLAM, in addition to automatic removing the noise point cloud to further improve the consistency of the underground roadway map. A lightweight and efficient loop detection and optimization based on rules and GICP is designed. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated in four scenes (such as the underground mine laboratory), and compared with the existing 3D laser SLAM method (such as Lidar Odometry and Mapping (LOAM)).

The key challenge preventing the deployment of these 3D scene learners on large-scale video data is their dependence on precise camera poses from structure-from-motion, which is prohibitively expensive to run at scale. We propose a method that jointly reconstructs camera poses and 3D neural scene representations online and in a single forward pass. We estimate poses by first lifting frame-to-frame optical flow to 3D scene flow via differentiable rendering, preserving locality and shift-equivariance of the image processing backbone. SE(3) camera pose estimation is then performed via a weighted least-squares fit to the scene flow field. This formulation enables us to jointly supervise pose estimation and a generalizable neural scene representation via re-rendering the input video, and thus, train end-to-end and fully self-supervised on real-world video datasets. We demonstrate that our method performs robustly on diverse, real-world video, notably on sequences traditionally challenging to optimization-based pose estimation techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"Du","given":"Yilun"},{"family":"Tewari","given":"Ayush"},{"family":"Sitzmann","given":"Vincent"}],"citation-key":"smithFlowCamTrainingGeneralizable2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,31]]},"number":"arXiv:2306.00180","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"FlowCam: Training Generalizable 3D Radiance Fields without Camera Poses via Pixel-Aligned Scene Flow","title-short":"FlowCam","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00180"},{"id":"smithFlowMapHighQualityCamera2024","type":"article","abstract":"This paper introduces FlowMap, an end-to-end differentiable method that solves for precise camera poses, camera intrinsics, and per-frame dense depth of a video sequence.

Compared with other differentiable renderers, PyTorch3D is more modular and efficient, allowing users to more easily extend it while also gracefully scaling to large meshes and images. We compare the PyTorch3D operators and renderer with other implementations and demonstrate significant speed and memory improvements. We also use PyTorch3D to improve the state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D mesh and point cloud prediction from 2D images on ShapeNet. PyTorch3D is open-source and we hope it will help accelerate research in 3D deep learning.","note":"arXiv:2007.08501 [cs]","number":"arXiv:2007.08501","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Accelerating 3D Deep Learning with PyTorch3D","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08501","author":[{"family":"Ravi","given":"Nikhila"},{"family":"Reizenstein","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Novotny","given":"David"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Taylor"},{"family":"Lo","given":"Wan-Yen"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Gkioxari","given":"Georgia"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,17]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,16]]},"citation-key":"raviAccelerating3DDeep2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"raviAccelerating3DDeep2020"},{"id":"chenIndoorCameraPose2022","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            Many vision‐based indoor localization methods require tedious and comprehensive pre‐mapping of built environments. This research proposes a mapping‐free approach to estimating indoor camera poses based on a 3D style‐transferred building information model (BIM) and photogrammetry technique. To address the cross‐domain gap between virtual 3D models and real‐life photographs, a CycleGAN model was developed to transform BIM renderings into photorealistic images. A photogrammetry‐based algorithm was developed to estimate camera pose using the visual and spatial information extracted from the style‐transferred BIM. The experiments demonstrated the efficacy of CycleGAN in bridging the cross‐domain gap, which significantly improved performance in terms of image retrieval and feature correspondence detection. With the 3D coordinates retrieved from BIM, the proposed method can achieve near real‐time camera pose estimation with an accuracy of 1.38 m and 10.1° in indoor environments.","container-title":"Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering","DOI":"10.1111/mice.12714","ISSN":"1093-9687, 1467-8667","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Computer aided Civil Eng","language":"en","page":"335-353","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Indoor camera pose estimation via style‐transfer 3D models","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mice.12714","volume":"37","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Donghai"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Weisheng"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"citation-key":"chenIndoorCameraPose2022","library":"My Library","citekey":"chenIndoorCameraPose2022"},{"id":"huang2DGaussianSplatting2024","type":"paper-conference","abstract":"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently revolutionized radiance field reconstruction, achieving high quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering speed without baking.

We present 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), a novel approach to model and reconstruct geometrically accurate radiance fields from multi-view images. Our key idea is to collapse the 3D volume into a set of 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks. Unlike 3D Gaussians, 2D Gaussians provide view-consistent geometry while modeling surfaces intrinsically. To accurately recover thin surfaces and achieve stable optimization, we introduce a perspective-correct 2D splatting process utilizing ray-splat intersection and rasterization. Additionally, we incorporate depth distortion and normal consistency terms to further enhance the quality of the reconstructions. We demonstrate that our differentiable renderer allows for noise-free and detailed geometry reconstruction while maintaining competitive appearance quality, fast training speed, and real-time rendering.","container-title":"Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques Conference Conference Papers '24","DOI":"10.1145/3641519.3657428","note":"arXiv:2403.17888 [cs]","page":"1-11","source":"arXiv.org","title":"2D Gaussian Splatting for Geometrically Accurate Radiance Fields","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17888","author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Binbin"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Zehao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Anpei"},{"family":"Geiger","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Shenghua"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,13]]},"citation-key":"huang2DGaussianSplatting2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"huang2DGaussianSplatting2024"},{"id":"sunMM3DGSSLAMMultimodal2024","type":"article","abstract":"Simultaneous localization and mapping is essential for position tracking and scene understanding. 3D Gaussian-based map representations enable photorealistic reconstruction and real-time rendering of scenes using multiple posed cameras.

We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes.
