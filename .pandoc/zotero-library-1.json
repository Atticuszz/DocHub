  {"id":"ressSLAMIndoorMapping2024","abstract":"Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), i.e., the reconstruction of the environment represented by a (3D) map and the concurrent pose estimation, has made astonishing progress. Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment. Additionally, dense and accurate depth maps are generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, which we plan to use in the context of our project aiming on the automatic construction and site monitoring.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ress","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Skuddis","given":"David"},{"family":"Haala","given":"Norbert"},{"family":"Soergel","given":"Uwe"}],"citation-key":"ressSLAMIndoorMapping2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2404.17215","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,26]]},"number":"arXiv:2404.17215","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"SLAM for Indoor Mapping of Wide Area Construction Environments","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17215"},
  {"id":"guptaNDT6DColor2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            Registration of point cloud data containing both depth and color information is critical for a variety of applications, including in‐field robotic plant manipulation, crop growth modeling, and autonomous navigation. However, current state‐of‐the‐art registration methods often fail in challenging agricultural field conditions due to factors such as occlusions, plant density, and variable illumination. To address these issues, we propose the NDT‐6D registration method, which is a color‐based variation of the Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) registration approach for point clouds. Our method computes correspondences between pointclouds using both geometric and color information and minimizes the distance between these correspondences using only the three‐dimensional (3D) geometric dimensions. We evaluate the method using the GRAPES3D data set collected with a commercial‐grade RGB‐D sensor mounted on a mobile platform in a vineyard. Results show that registration methods that only rely on depth information fail to provide quality registration for the tested data set. The proposed color‐based variation outperforms state‐of‐the‐art methods with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1–1.6 cm for NDT‐6D compared with 1.1–2.3 cm for other color‐information‐based methods and 1.2–13.7 cm for noncolor‐information‐based methods. The proposed method is shown to be robust against noises using the TUM RGBD data set by artificially adding noise present in an outdoor scenario. The relative pose error (RPE) increased 14% for our method compared to an increase of 75% for the best‐performing registration method. The obtained average accuracy suggests that the NDT‐6D registration methods can be used for in‐field precision agriculture applications, for example, crop detection, size‐based maturity estimation, and growth modeling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Gupta","given":"Himanshu"},{"family":"Lilienthal","given":"Achim J."},{"family":"Andreasson","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Kurtser","given":"Polina"}],"citation-key":"guptaNDT6DColor2023","container-title":"Journal of Field Robotics","container-title-short":"Journal of Field Robotics","DOI":"10.1002/rob.22194","ISSN":"1556-4959, 1556-4967","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1603-1619","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"NDT‐6D for color registration in agri‐robotic applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rob.22194","volume":"40"},
  {"id":"caiIkdTreeIncrementalKD2021","abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient data structure, ikd-Tree, for dynamic space partition. The ikd-Tree incrementally updates a k-d tree with new coming points only, leading to much lower computation time than existing static k-d trees. Besides point-wise operations, the ikd-Tree supports several features such as box-wise operations and down-sampling that are practically useful in robotic applications. In parallel to the incremental operations (i.e., insert, re-insert, and delete), ikd-Tree actively monitors the tree structure and partially re-balances the tree, which enables efficient nearest point search in later stages. The ikd-Tree is carefully engineered and supports multi-thread parallel computing to maximize the overall efficiency. We validate the ikd-Tree in both theory and practical experiments. On theory level, a complete time complexity analysis is presented to prove the high efficiency. On experiment level, the ikd-Tree is tested on both randomized datasets and real-world LiDAR point data in LiDAR-inertial odometry and mapping application. In all tests, ikd-Tree consumes only 4% of the running time in a static k-d tree.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cai","given":"Yixi"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Fu"}],"citation-key":"caiIkdTreeIncrementalKD2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2102.10808","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,22]]},"number":"arXiv:2102.10808","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"ikd-Tree: An Incremental K-D Tree for Robotic Applications","title-short":"ikd-Tree","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10808"},

  {"id":"renRobustGICPBased3D2019","abstract":"Unmanned mining is one of the most effective methods to solve mine safety and low efficiency. However, it is the key to accurate localization and mapping for underground mining environment. A novel graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) optimization method is proposed, which is based on Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) three-dimensional (3D) point cloud registration between consecutive frames, between consecutive key frames and between loop frames, and is constrained by roadway plane and loop. GICP-based 3D point cloud registration between consecutive frames and consecutive key frames is first combined to optimize laser odometer constraints without other sensors such as inertial measurement unit (IMU). According to the characteristics of the roadway, the innovative extraction of the roadway plane as the node constraint of pose graph SLAM, in addition to automatic removing the noise point cloud to further improve the consistency of the underground roadway map. A lightweight and efficient loop detection and optimization based on rules and GICP is designed. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated in four scenes (such as the underground mine laboratory), and compared with the existing 3D laser SLAM method (such as Lidar Odometry and Mapping (LOAM)). The results show that the algorithm could realize low drift localization and point cloud map construction. This method provides technical support for localization and navigation of underground mining environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ren","given":"Zhuli"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liguan"},{"family":"Bi","given":"Lin"}],"citation-key":"renRobustGICPBased3D2019","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s19132915","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"13","page":"2915","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Robust GICP-Based 3D LiDAR SLAM for Underground Mining Environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/13/2915","volume":"19"},

Recent advancements in dense representation SLAM have highlighted the potential of leveraging neural scene representation and 3D Gaussian representation for high-fidelity spatial representation. In this paper, we propose a novel dense representation SLAM approach with a fusion of Generalized Iterative Closest Point (G-ICP) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). In contrast to existing methods, we utilize a single Gaussian map for both tracking and mapping, resulting in mutual benefits. Through the exchange of covariances between tracking and mapping processes with scale alignment techniques, we minimize redundant computations and achieve an efficient system. Additionally, we enhance tracking accuracy and mapping quality through our keyframe selection methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing an incredibly fast speed up to 107 FPS (for the entire system) and superior quality of the reconstructed map.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ha","given":"Seongbo"},{"family":"Yeon","given":"Jiung"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Hyeonwoo"}],"citation-key":"haRGBDGSICPSLAM2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,22]]},"number":"arXiv:2403.12550","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"RGBD GS-ICP SLAM","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12550"},

Recent advances in neural radiance field techniques have shown that it is a powerful tool for environment representation. More recent neural rendering algorithms have significantly improved both training duration and rendering speed. Plenoxels introduced a fully-differentiable radiance field technique that uses Plenoptic volume elements contained in voxels for rendering, offering reduced training times and better rendering accuracy, while also eliminating the neural net component. In this work, we introduce a 6-DoF monocular RGB-only pose estimation procedure for Plenoxels, which seeks to recover the ground truth camera pose after a perturbation. We employ a variation on classical template matching techniques, using stochastic gradient descent to optimize the pose by minimizing errors in re-rendering. In particular, we examine an approach that takes advantage of the rapid rendering speed of Plenoxels to numerically approximate part of the pose gradient, using a central differencing technique. We show that such methods are effective in pose estimation. Finally, we perform ablations over key components of the problem space, with a particular focus on image subsampling and Plenoxel grid resolution.

Extending into 3D may advance many new applications including autonomous vehicles, virtual and augmented reality, authoring 3D content, and even improving 2D recognition.

We believe that some of this disparity is due to the engineering challenges involved in 3D deep learning, such as efficiently processing heterogeneous data and reframing graphics operations to be differentiable. We address these challenges by introducing PyTorch3D, a library of modular, efficient, and differentiable operators for 3D deep learning. It includes a fast, modular differentiable renderer for meshes and point clouds, enabling analysis-by-synthesis approaches. Compared with other differentiable renderers, PyTorch3D is more modular and efficient, allowing users to more easily extend it while also gracefully scaling to large meshes and images. We compare the PyTorch3D operators and renderer with other implementations and demonstrate significant speed and memory improvements. We also use PyTorch3D to improve the state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D mesh and point cloud prediction from 2D images on ShapeNet.

  {"id":"fanInstantSplatUnboundedSparseview2024","abstract":"While novel view synthesis (NVS) from a sparse set of images has advanced significantly in 3D computer vision, it relies on precise initial estimation of camera parameters using Structure-from-Motion (SfM). For instance, the recently developed Gaussian Splatting depends heavily on the accuracy of SfM-derived points and poses. However, SfM processes are time-consuming and often prove unreliable in sparse-view scenarios, where matched features are scarce, leading to accumulated errors and limited generalization capability across datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel and efficient framework to enhance robust NVS from sparse-view images. Our framework, InstantSplat, integrates multi-view stereo(MVS) predictions with point-based representations to construct 3D Gaussians of large-scale scenes from sparse-view data within seconds, addressing the aforementioned performance and efficiency issues by SfM. Specifically, InstantSplat generates densely populated surface points across all training views and determines the initial camera parameters using pixel-alignment. Nonetheless, the MVS points are not globally accurate, and the pixel-wise prediction from all views results in an excessive Gaussian number, yielding a overparameterized scene representation that compromises both training speed and accuracy. To address this issue, we employ a grid-based, confidence-aware Farthest Point Sampling to strategically position point primitives at representative locations in parallel. Next, we enhance pose accuracy and tune scene parameters through a gradient-based joint optimization framework from self-supervision. By employing this simplified framework, InstantSplat achieves a substantial reduction in training time, from hours to mere seconds, and demonstrates robust performance across various numbers of views in diverse datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Zhiwen"},{"family":"Cong","given":"Wenyan"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Kairun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Xinghao"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Danfei"},{"family":"Ivanovic","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Pavone","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Pavlakos","given":"Georgios"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhangyang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yue"}],"citation-key":"fanInstantSplatUnboundedSparseview2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2403.20309","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"number":"arXiv:2403.20309","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"InstantSplat: Unbounded Sparse-view Pose-free Gaussian Splatting in 40 Seconds","title-short":"InstantSplat","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20309"},

This research proposes a mapping‐free approach to estimating indoor camera poses based on a 3D style‐transferred building information model (BIM) and photogrammetry technique. To address the cross‐domain gap between virtual 3D models and real‐life photographs, a CycleGAN model was developed to transform BIM renderings into photorealistic images. A photogrammetry‐based algorithm was developed to estimate camera pose using the visual and spatial information extracted from the style‐transferred BIM. The experiments demonstrated the efficacy of CycleGAN in bridging the cross‐domain gap, which significantly improved performance in terms of image retrieval and feature correspondence detection. With the 3D coordinates retrieved from BIM, the proposed method can achieve near real‐time camera pose estimation with an accuracy of 1.38 m and 10.1° in indoor environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Donghai"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Weisheng"}],"citation-key":"chenIndoorCameraPose2022","container-title":"Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering","container-title-short":"Computer aided Civil Eng","DOI":"10.1111/mice.12714","ISSN":"1093-9687, 1467-8667","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"335-353","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Indoor camera pose estimation via style‐transfer 3D models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mice.12714","volume":"37"},

To accurately recover thin surfaces and achieve stable optimization, we introduce a perspective-correct 2D splatting process utilizing ray-splat intersection and rasterization.

Our method, MM3DGS, addresses the limitations of prior neural radiance field-based representations by enabling faster rendering, scale awareness, and improved trajectory tracking. Our framework enables keyframe-based mapping and tracking utilizing loss functions that incorporate relative pose transformations from pre-integrated inertial measurements, depth estimates, and measures of photometric rendering quality. We also release a multi-modal dataset, UT-MM, collected from a mobile robot equipped with a camera and an inertial measurement unit. Experimental evaluation on several scenes from the dataset shows that MM3DGS achieves 3x improvement in tracking and 5% improvement in photometric rendering quality compared to the current 3DGS SLAM state-of-the-art, while allowing real-time rendering of a high-resolution dense 3D map.

  {"id":"huCGSLAMEfficientDense2024","abstract":"Recently neural radiance fields (NeRF) have been widely exploited as 3D representations for dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Despite their notable successes in surface modeling and novel view synthesis, existing NeRF-based methods are hindered by their computationally intensive and time-consuming volume rendering pipeline. This paper presents an efficient dense RGB-D SLAM system, i.e., CG-SLAM, based on a novel uncertainty-aware 3D Gaussian field with high consistency and geometric stability. Through an in-depth analysis of Gaussian Splatting, we propose several techniques to construct a consistent and stable 3D Gaussian field suitable for tracking and mapping. Additionally, a novel depth uncertainty model is proposed to ensure the selection of valuable Gaussian primitives during optimization, thereby improving tracking efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CG-SLAM achieves superior tracking and mapping performance with a notable tracking speed of up to 15 Hz. We will make our source code publicly available.

  {"id":"pengRTGSLAMRealtime3D2024","abstract":"We present Real-time Gaussian SLAM (RTG-SLAM), a real-time 3D reconstruction system with an RGBD camera for large-scale environments using Gaussian splatting. The system features a compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the state-of-the-art NeRF-based RGBD SLAM, our system achieves comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the speed and half the memory cost, and shows superior performance in the realism of novel view synthesis and camera tracking accuracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Zhexi"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Tianjia"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jingke"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jingdong"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Kun"}],"citation-key":"pengRTGSLAMRealtime3D2024","DOI":"10.1145/3658233","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,8]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"RTG-SLAM: Real-time 3D Reconstruction at Scale using Gaussian Splatting","title-short":"RTG-SLAM","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19706"},

  {"id":"yuGaussianOpacityFields2024","abstract":"Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results, while allowing the rendering of high-resolution images in real-time. However, leveraging 3D Gaussians for surface reconstruction poses significant challenges due to the explicit and disconnected nature of 3D Gaussians. In this work, we present Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF), a novel approach for efficient, high-quality, and compact surface reconstruction in unbounded scenes. Our GOF is derived from ray-tracing-based volume rendering of 3D Gaussians, enabling direct geometry extraction from 3D Gaussians by identifying its levelset, without resorting to Poisson reconstruction or TSDF fusion as in previous work. We approximate the surface normal of Gaussians as the normal of the ray-Gaussian intersection plane, enabling the application of regularization that significantly enhances geometry. Furthermore, we develop an efficient geometry extraction method utilizing marching tetrahedra, where the tetrahedral grids are induced from 3D Gaussians and thus adapt to the scene's complexity. Our evaluations reveal that GOF surpasses existing 3DGS-based methods in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Further, it compares favorably to, or even outperforms, neural implicit methods in both quality and speed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Zehao"},{"family":"Sattler","given":"Torsten"},{"family":"Geiger","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"yuGaussianOpacityFields2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,16]]},"number":"arXiv:2404.10772","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Gaussian Opacity Fields: Efficient and Compact Surface Reconstruction in Unbounded Scenes","title-short":"Gaussian Opacity Fields","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10772"},

  {"id":"zhuNICERSLAMNeuralImplicit2024","abstract":"Neural implicit representations have recently become popular in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), especially in dense visual SLAM. However, existing works either rely on RGB-D sensors or require a separate monocular SLAM approach for camera tracking, and fail to produce high-fidelity 3D dense reconstructions. To address these shortcomings, we present NICER-SLAM, a dense RGB SLAM system that simultaneously optimizes for camera poses and a hierarchical neural implicit map representation, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. To facilitate the optimization process for mapping, we integrate additional supervision signals including easy-to-obtain monocular geometric cues and optical flow, and also introduce a simple warping loss to further enforce geometric consistency. Moreover, to further boost performance in complex large-scale scenes, we also propose a local adaptive transformation from signed distance functions (SDFs) to density in the volume rendering equation. On multiple challenging indoor and outdoor datasets, NICER-SLAM demonstrates strong performance in dense mapping, novel view synthesis, and tracking, even competitive with recent RGB-D SLAM systems.

  {"id":"daiBundleFusionRealTimeGlobally2017","abstract":"Real-time, high-quality, 3D scanning of large-scale scenes is key to mixed reality and robotic applications. However, scalability brings challenges of drift in pose estimation, introducing significant errors in the accumulated model. Approaches often require hours of offline processing to globally correct model errors. Recent online methods demonstrate compelling results but suffer from (1) needing minutes to perform online correction, preventing true real-time use; (2) brittle frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation, resulting in many tracking failures; or (3) supporting only unstructured point-based representations, which limit scan quality and applicability. We systematically address these issues with a novel, real-time, end-to-end reconstruction framework. At its core is a robust pose estimation strategy, optimizing per frame for a global set of camera poses by considering the complete history of RGB-D input with an efficient hierarchical approach. We remove the heavy reliance on temporal tracking and continually localize to the globally optimized frames instead. We contribute a parallelizable optimization framework, which employs correspondences based on sparse features and dense geometric and photometric matching. Our approach estimates globally optimized (i.e., bundle adjusted) poses in real time, supports robust tracking with recovery from gross tracking failures (i.e., relocalization), and re-estimates the 3D model in real time to ensure global consistency, all within a single framework. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online systems with quality on par to offline methods, but with unprecedented speed and scan completeness. Our framework leads to a comprehensive online scanning solution for large indoor environments, enabling ease of use and high-quality results.\n              1","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Dai","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Nießner","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Zollhöfer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Izadi","given":"Shahram"},{"family":"Theobalt","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"daiBundleFusionRealTimeGlobally2017","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Graphics","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

  {"id":"prisacariuFrameworkVolumetricIntegration2014","abstract":"Volumetric models have become a popular representation for 3D scenes in recent years. One of the breakthroughs leading to their popularity was KinectFusion, where the focus is on 3D reconstruction using RGB-D sensors. However, monocular SLAM has since also been tackled with very similar approaches. Representing the reconstruction volumetrically as a truncated signed distance function leads to most of the simplicity and efficiency that can be achieved with GPU implementations of these systems. However, this representation is also memory-intensive and limits the applicability to small scale reconstructions. Several avenues have been explored for overcoming this limitation. With the aim of summarizing them and providing for a fast and flexible 3D reconstruction pipeline, we propose a new, unifying framework called InfiniTAM. The core idea is that individual steps like camera tracking, scene representation and integration of new data can easily be replaced and adapted to the needs of the user. Along with the framework we also provide a set of components for scalable reconstruction: two implementations of camera trackers, based on RGB data and on depth data, two representations of the 3D volumetric data, a dense volume and one based on hashes of subblocks, and an optional module for swapping subblocks in and out of the typically limited GPU memory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Prisacariu","given":"Victor Adrian"},{"family":"Kähler","given":"Olaf"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Ming Ming"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Carl Yuheng"},{"family":"Valentin","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Torr","given":"Philip H.

By using a fused volumetric surface reconstruction we achieve a much higher quality map over what would be achieved using raw RGB-D point clouds. In this paper we highlight three key techniques associated with applying a volumetric fusion-based mapping system to the SLAM problem in real time. First, the use of a GPU-based 3D cyclical buffer trick to efficiently extend dense every-frame volumetric fusion of depth maps to function over an unbounded spatial region. Second, overcoming camera pose estimation limitations in a wide variety of environments by combining both dense geometric and photometric camera pose constraints. Third, efficiently updating the dense map according to place recognition and subsequent loop closure constraints by the use of an ‘as-rigid-as-possible’ space deformation. We present results on a wide variety of aspects of the system and show through evaluation on de facto standard RGB-D benchmarks that our system performs strongly in terms of trajectory estimation, map quality and computational performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Whelan","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kaess","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Johannsson","given":"Hordur"},{"family":"Fallon","given":"Maurice"},{"family":"Leonard","given":"John J."},{"family":"McDonald","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"whelanRealtimeLargescaleDense2015","container-title":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","container-title-short":"The International Journal of Robotics Research","DOI":"10.1177/0278364914551008","ISSN":"0278-3649, 1741-3176","issue":"4-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4]]},"language":"en","page":"598-626","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Real-time large-scale dense RGB-D SLAM with volumetric fusion","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364914551008","volume":"34"},

We reduce this cost with a versatile new input encoding that permits the use of a smaller network without sacrificing quality, thus significantly reducing the number of floating point and memory access operations: a small neural network is augmented by a multiresolution hash table of trainable feature vectors whose values are optimized through stochastic gradient descent. The multiresolution structure allows the network to disambiguate hash collisions, making for a simple architecture that is trivial to parallelize on modern GPUs. We leverage this parallelism by implementing the whole system using fully-fused CUDA kernels with a focus on minimizing wasted bandwidth and compute operations.

  {"id":"wangVoGEDifferentiableVolume2024","abstract":"The Gaussian reconstruction kernels have been proposed by Westover (1990) and studied by the computer graphics community back in the 90s, which gives an alternative representation of object 3D geometry from meshes and point clouds. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art (SoTA) differentiable renderers, Liu et al. (2019), use rasterization to collect triangles or points on each image pixel and blend them based on the viewing distance. In this paper, we propose VoGE, which utilizes the volumetric Gaussian reconstruction kernels as geometric primitives. The VoGE rendering pipeline uses ray tracing to capture the nearest primitives and blends them as mixtures based on their volume density distributions along the rays. To efficiently render via VoGE, we propose an approximate closeform solution for the volume density aggregation and a coarse-to-fine rendering strategy. Finally, we provide a CUDA implementation of VoGE, which enables real-time level rendering with a competitive rendering speed in comparison to PyTorch3D. Quantitative and qualitative experiment results show VoGE outperforms SoTA counterparts when applied to various vision tasks, e.g., object pose estimation, shape/texture fitting, and occlusion reasoning.

  {"id":"luitenDynamic3DGaussians2023","abstract":"We present a method that simultaneously addresses the tasks of dynamic scene novel-view synthesis and six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) tracking of all dense scene elements. We follow an analysis-by-synthesis framework, inspired by recent work that models scenes as a collection of 3D Gaussians which are optimized to reconstruct input images via differentiable rendering. To model dynamic scenes, we allow Gaussians to move and rotate over time while enforcing that they have persistent color, opacity, and size. By regularizing Gaussians' motion and rotation with local-rigidity constraints, we show that our Dynamic 3D Gaussians correctly model the same area of physical space over time, including the rotation of that space. Dense 6-DOF tracking and dynamic reconstruction emerges naturally from persistent dynamic view synthesis, without requiring any correspondence or flow as input. We demonstrate a large number of downstream applications enabled by our representation, including first-person view synthesis, dynamic compositional scene synthesis, and 4D video editing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Luiten","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Kopanas","given":"Georgios"},{"family":"Leibe","given":"Bastian"},{"family":"Ramanan","given":"Deva"}],"citation-key":"luitenDynamic3DGaussians2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,18]]},"number":"arXiv:2308.09713","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Dynamic 3D Gaussians: Tracking by Persistent Dynamic View Synthesis","title-short":"Dynamic 3D Gaussians","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09713"},

  {"id":"tangDreamGaussianGenerativeGaussian2024","abstract":"Recent advances in 3D content creation mostly leverage optimization-based 3D generation via score distillation sampling (SDS). Though promising results have been exhibited, these methods often suffer from slow per-sample optimization, limiting their practical usage. In this paper, we propose DreamGaussian, a novel 3D content generation framework that achieves both efficiency and quality simultaneously. Our key insight is to design a generative 3D Gaussian Splatting model with companioned mesh extraction and texture refinement in UV space. In contrast to the occupancy pruning used in Neural Radiance Fields, we demonstrate that the progressive densification of 3D Gaussians converges significantly faster for 3D generative tasks. To further enhance the texture quality and facilitate downstream applications, we introduce an efficient algorithm to convert 3D Gaussians into textured meshes and apply a fine-tuning stage to refine the details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive generation quality of our proposed approach. Notably, DreamGaussian produces high-quality textured meshes in just 2 minutes from a single-view image, achieving approximately 10 times acceleration compared to existing methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Jiaxiang"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Jiawei"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Hang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ziwei"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Gang"}],"citation-key":"tangDreamGaussianGenerativeGaussian2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,29]]},"number":"arXiv:2309.16653","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"DreamGaussian: Generative Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Content Creation","title-short":"DreamGaussian","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16653"},
  {"id":"yiGaussianDreamerFastGeneration2024","abstract":"In recent times, the generation of 3D assets from text prompts has shown impressive results. Both 2D and 3D diffusion models can help generate decent 3D objects based on prompts. 3D diffusion models have good 3D consistency, but their quality and generalization are limited as trainable 3D data is expensive and hard to obtain. 2D diffusion models enjoy strong abilities of generalization and fine generation, but 3D consistency is hard to guarantee. This paper attempts to bridge the power from the two types of diffusion models via the recent explicit and efficient 3D Gaussian splatting representation. A fast 3D object generation framework, named as GaussianDreamer, is proposed, where the 3D diffusion model provides priors for initialization and the 2D diffusion model enriches the geometry and appearance. Operations of noisy point growing and color perturbation are introduced to enhance the initialized Gaussians. Our GaussianDreamer can generate a high-quality 3D instance or 3D avatar within 15 minutes on one GPU, much faster than previous methods, while the generated instances can be directly rendered in real time.
