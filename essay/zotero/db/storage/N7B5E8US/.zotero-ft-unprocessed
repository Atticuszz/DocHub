Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment. Additionally, dense and accurate depth maps are generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, which we plan to use in the context of our project aiming on the automatic construction and site monitoring.  \n \nSubjects: \tRobotics (cs.RO) ; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) \nCite as: \tarXiv:2404.17215 [cs.RO] \n  \t(or arXiv:2404.17215v1 [cs.RO] for this version) \n  \thttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.17215 \nFocus to learn more \narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite \nSubmission history \nFrom: Norbert Haala [ view email ] \n[v1] Fri, 26 Apr 2024 07:42:20 UTC (34,521 KB) \nFull-text links: \nAccess Paper: \n \n    View a PDF of the paper titled SLAM for Indoor Mapping of Wide Area Construction Environments, by Vincent Ress and 4 other authors \n    View PDF \n    HTML (experimental) \n    TeX Source \n    Other Formats  \n \nview license \nCurrent browse context: \ncs.RO \n< prev   |   next > \nnew | recent | 2404 \nChange to browse by: \ncs \ncs.CV \nReferences & Citations \n \n    NASA ADS \n    Google Scholar \n    Semantic Scholar \n \na export BibTeX citation Loading... \nBookmark \nBibSonomy logo Reddit logo \nBibliographic Tools \nBibliographic and Citation Tools \nBibliographic Explorer Toggle \nBibliographic Explorer ( What is the Explorer? ) \nLitmaps Toggle \nLitmaps ( What is Litmaps? ) \nscite.ai Toggle \nscite Smart Citations ( What are Smart Citations? ) \nCode, Data, Media \nDemos \nRelated Papers \nAbout arXivLabs \nWhich authors of this paper are endorsers? | Disable MathJax ( What is MathJax? ) \n \n    About \n    Help \n \n    contact arXiv Click here to contact arXiv Contact \n    subscribe to arXiv mailings Click here to subscribe Subscribe \n \n    Copyright \n    Privacy Policy \n \n    Web Accessibility Assistance \n \n    arXiv Operational Status \n    Get status notifications via email or slack \n \n"}
