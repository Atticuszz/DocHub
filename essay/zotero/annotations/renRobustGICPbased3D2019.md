> [!annotation-red] Highlight
> There are four contributions in this paper: Firstly, Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP)-based 3D point cloud registration between consecutive frames and consecutive key frames is first combined to optimize laser odometer constraints, which plays a major role in the unstructured environment. Secondly, a fast point cloud segmentation based on RANdom Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is used to extracts the roadway plane, which serves as a landmark to construct the observation constraint in the graph SLAM optimization. Thirdly, a lightweight and efficient loop detection and optimization based on rules and GICP is designed, which is applied to co(p.
