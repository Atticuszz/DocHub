GSplatLoc，这是我的一个基于3d高斯显示场景表示法的重投影误差方法，你给我取几个标题并且一个标题后面的介绍就像这样SplaTAM: Splat, Track & Map 3D Gaussians for Dense RGB-D SLAM，Gaussian-SLAM: Photo-realistic Dense SLAM with Gaussian Splatting，重投影3d高斯姿态估计超高精度估计方法，旋转误差几乎为0


侧重点应该是重投影和姿态优化方法


**GSplatLoc: Ultra-Precise Pose Optimization via 3D Gaussian Reprojection** GSplatLoc offers an ultra-precise approach to pose optimization using 3D Gaussian reprojection. By meticulously minimizing reprojection errors, this method achieves exceptional accuracy in 3D pose estimation, essential for detailed and realistic scene reconstruction.


Abstract. We present a dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method that uses 3D Gaussians as a scene representation. Our approach enables interactive-time reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering from real-world single-camera RGBD videos. To this end, we propose a novel effective strategy for seeding new Gaussians for newly explored areas and their effective online optimization that is independent of the scene size and thus scalable to larger scenes. This is achieved by organizing the scene into sub-maps which are independently optimized and do not need to be kept in memory. We further accomplish frame-tomodel camera tracking by minimizing photometric and geometric losses between the input and rendered frames. The Gaussian representation allows for high-quality photo-realistic real-time rendering of real-world scenes. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates competitive or superior performance in mapping, tracking, and rendering compared to existing neural dense SLAM methods.，Dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for robotics and augmented reality applications. However, current methods are often hampered by the nonvolumetric or implicit way they represent a scene. This work introduces SplaTAM, an approach that, for the first time, leverages explicit volumetric representations, i.e., 3D Gaussians, to enable high-fidelity reconstruction from a single unposed RGB-D camera, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. SplaTAM employs a simple online tracking and mapping system tailored to the underlying Gaussian representation. It utilizes a silhouette mask to elegantly capture the presence of scene density. This combination enables several benefits over prior representations, including fast rendering and dense optimization, quickly determining if areas have been previously mapped, and structured map expansion by adding more Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that SplaTAM achieves up to 2× superior performance in camera pose estimation, map construction, and novel-view synthesis over existing methods, paving the way for more immersive high-fidelity SLAM applications.，模仿他们的风格，给我写一个abstract，标题我选用了GSplatLoc: Ultra-Precise Pose Optimization via 3D Gaussian Reprojection，我们提出来一种基于3d高斯显示体积表示时的一种高精度姿态优化方法，3d高斯的重投影，适用于没有姿态的RGB-D相机，主要针对于rgb-d数据，主要利用了通过观察不同视角的现有3d高斯和实际拍摄的深度图的进行优化当前姿态，实现了旋转误差几乎为0，平移误差为0.01mm以内，并且和现有对rgb0d数据姿态估计的点云对其算法做了详细的比较，姿态误差实现百倍提升




然后你开始给我写一些公式，深度图的定义，2.2 Depth Compositing of Gaussians We directly follow the tile sorting method introduced by [Kerbl et al., 2023], which bins the 2D Gaussians into 16 × 16 tiles and sorts them per tile by depth. For each Gaussian, we compute the axis-aligned bounding box around the 99% confidence ellipse of each 2D projected covariance (3 sigma), and include it in a tile bin if its bounding box intersects with the tile. We then apply the tile sorting algorithm as presented in Appendix C of [Kerbl et al., 2023] to get a list of Gaussians sorted by depth for each tile. We then rasterize the sorted Gaussians within each tile. For a color at a pixel i, let n index the N Gaussians involved in that pixel. Ci = ∑ n≤N cn · αn · Tn , where Tn = ∏ m<n (1 − αm ). (7) We compute α with the 2D covariance Σ′ ∈R2× 2 and opacity parameters: αn = on · exp(−σn ), σn = 1 2 ∆⊤ n Σ ′−1∆ n , where ∆ ∈R2 and is the offset between the pixel center and the 2D Gaussian center μ′ ∈R2. We compute Tn online as we iterate through the Gaussians front to back，帮我先定义一下深度信息的数学公式，根据图片内容，我需要定义重投影采用的方法是什么？以及损失是如何设计的，采用一部分深度l1损失，一部分深度轮廓损失，
