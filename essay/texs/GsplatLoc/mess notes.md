**GSplatLoc: Ultra-Precise Pose Optimization via 3D Gaussian Reprojection** GSplatLoc offers an ultra-precise approach to pose optimization using 3D Gaussian reprojection. By meticulously minimizing reprojection errors, this method achieves exceptional accuracy in 3D pose estimation, essential for detailed and realistic scene reconstruction.


Abstract. We present a dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method that uses 3D Gaussians as a scene representation. Our approach enables interactive-time reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering from real-world single-camera RGBD videos. To this end, we propose a novel effective strategy for seeding new Gaussians for newly explored areas and their effective online optimization that is independent of the scene size and thus scalable to larger scenes. This is achieved by organizing the scene into sub-maps which are independently optimized and do not need to be kept in memory. We further accomplish frame-tomodel camera tracking by minimizing photometric and geometric losses between the input and rendered frames. The Gaussian representation allows for high-quality photo-realistic real-time rendering of real-world scenes. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates competitive or superior performance in mapping, tracking, and rendering compared to existing neural dense SLAM methods.，Dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for robotics and augmented reality applications. However, current methods are often hampered by the nonvolumetric or implicit way they represent a scene. This work introduces SplaTAM, an approach that, for the first time, leverages explicit volumetric representations, i.e., 3D Gaussians, to enable high-fidelity reconstruction from a single unposed RGB-D camera, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. SplaTAM employs a simple online tracking and mapping system tailored to the underlying Gaussian representation. It utilizes a silhouette mask to elegantly capture the presence of scene density. This combination enables several benefits over prior representations, including fast rendering and dense optimization, quickly determining if areas have been previously mapped, and structured map expansion by adding more Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that SplaTAM achieves up to 2× superior performance in camera pose estimation, map construction, and novel-view synthesis over existing methods, paving the way for more immersive high-fidelity SLAM applications.，模仿他们的风格，给我写一个abstract，标题我选用了GSplatLoc: Ultra-Precise Pose Optimization via 3D Gaussian Reprojection，我们提出来一种基于3d高斯显示体积表示时的一种高精度姿态优化方法，3d高斯的重投影，适用于没有姿态的RGB-D相机，主要针对于rgb-d数据，主要利用了通过观察不同视角的现有3d高斯和实际拍摄的深度图的进行优化当前姿态，实现了旋转误差几乎为0，平移误差为0.01mm以内，并且和现有对rgb0d数据姿态估计的点云对其算法做了详细的比较，姿态误差实现百倍提升




然后你开始给我写一些公式，深度图的定义，2.2 Depth Compositing of Gaussians We directly follow the tile sorting method introduced by [Kerbl et al., 2023], which bins the 2D Gaussians into 16 × 16 tiles and sorts them per tile by depth. For each Gaussian, we compute the axis-aligned bounding box around the 99% confidence ellipse of each 2D projected covariance (3 sigma), and include it in a tile bin if its bounding box intersects with the tile. We then apply the tile sorting algorithm as presented in Appendix C of [Kerbl et al., 2023] to get a list of Gaussians sorted by depth for each tile. We then rasterize the sorted Gaussians within each tile. For a color at a pixel i, let n index the N Gaussians involved in that pixel. Ci = ∑ n≤N cn · αn · Tn , where Tn = ∏ m<n (1 − αm ). (7) We compute α with the 2D covariance Σ′ ∈R2× 2 and opacity parameters: αn = on · exp(−σn ), σn = 1 2 ∆⊤ n Σ ′−1∆ n , where ∆ ∈R2 and is the offset between the pixel center and the 2D Gaussian center μ′ ∈R2. We compute Tn online as we iterate through the Gaussians front to back，帮我先定义一下深度信息的数学公式，根据图片内容，我需要定义重投影采用的方法是什么？以及损失是如何设计的，采用一部分深度l1损失，一部分深度轮廓损失，

# abstract

We present GSplatLoc, an innovative pose estimation method for RGB-D cameras that employs a volumetric representation of 3D Gaussians. This approach facilitates precise pose estimation by minimizing the loss based on the reprojection of 3D Gaussians from real depth maps captured from the estimated pose. Our method attains rotational errors close to zero and translational errors within 0.01mm, representing a substantial advancement in pose accuracy over existing point cloud registration algorithms, as well as explicit volumetric and implicit neural representation-based SLAM methods. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GSplatLoc significantly improves pose estimation accuracy, which contributes to increased robustness and fidelity in real-time 3D scene reconstruction, setting a new standard for localization techniques in dense mapping SLAM.

In the context of depth projection and rasterization for Gaussian splatting, the process involves several mathematical transformations to project 3D Gaussians onto a 2D image plane. Here’s a detailed explanation of the implementation based on the provided code and mathematical principles:

1. **Camera Transformations**:
    - **Extrinsics \(T_{cw}\)**: This matrix transforms points from the world coordinate space to the camera coordinate space. It is defined as:
      $$
      T_{cw} = \begin{bmatrix} R_{cw} & t_{cw} \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \in SE(3)
      $$
      where \( R_{cw} \) is the rotation matrix, and \( t_{cw} \) is the translation vector.

    - **Projection Matrix \(P\)**: This matrix transforms points from camera space to normalized device coordinates (ND). It is defined as:
      $$
      P = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{2f_x}{w} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{2f_y}{h} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{f+n}{f-n} & -\frac{2fn}{f-n} \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
      $$
      where \( w \) and \( h \) are the width and height of the output image, and \( n \) and \( f \) are the near and far clipping planes.

2. **Projection of 3D Gaussians**:
    - The 3D mean \( \mu \) of the Gaussian is projected into pixel space:
      $$
      t = T_{cw} \begin{bmatrix} \mu \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad t' = P t, \quad \mu' = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{w \cdot t'_x / t'_w + 1}{2} + c_x \\ \frac{h \cdot t'_y / t'_w + 1}{2} + c_y \end{bmatrix}
      $$

3. **Covariance Transformation**:
    - The 3D Gaussian covariance \( \Sigma \) is approximated in the 2D pixel space using the Jacobian \( J \):
      $$
      J = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{f_x}{t_z} & 0 & -\frac{f_x t_x}{t_z^2} \\ 0 & \frac{f_y}{t_z} & -\frac{f_y t_y}{t_z^2} \end{bmatrix}
      $$
      The 2D covariance \( \Sigma' \) is then:
      $$
      \Sigma' = J R_{cw} \Sigma R_{cw}^T J^T
      $$

4. **Depth Compositing**:
    - Gaussians are sorted by depth and composited from front to back. The color \( C_i \) at pixel \( i \) is computed as:
      $$
      C_i = \sum_{n \leq N} c_n \cdot \alpha_n \cdot T_n, \quad T_n = \prod_{m<n} (1 - \alpha_m)
      $$
    - The opacity \( \alpha \) is computed as:
      $$
      \alpha_n = o_n \cdot \exp(-\sigma_n), \quad \sigma_n = \frac{1}{2} \Delta_n^T \Sigma'^{-1} \Delta_n
      $$
      where \( \Delta \) is the offset between the pixel center and the 2D Gaussian center \( \mu' \).

#### Gaussian Model Explanation
The Gaussian model in the provided code involves several parameters and transformations:

1. **3D Means and Covariance**:
    - The 3D means (\( \mu \)) are derived from the point cloud data.
    - The 3D covariance (\( \Sigma \)) is parameterized by scale (\( s \)) and rotation quaternion (\( q \)). The covariance is computed as:
      $$
      \Sigma = R S S^T R^T, \quad R = \text{rotation matrix from quaternion } q, \quad S = \text{diag}(s)
      $$

2. **Color and Opacity Parameters**:
    - The colors are initially given by the RGB values and transformed into spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients.
    - Opacity is modeled using a logit transformation initialized to a certain value.

3. **Forward Pass**:
    - In the forward pass, the points, scales, opacities, and colors are used to render the Gaussians. The rendering involves projecting the 3D Gaussians into the 2D image plane and compositing them based on depth.

4. **Optimization Parameters**:
    - The learning rates for different parameters like scales, opacities, and colors are defined for the optimizer setup.

#### Depth-Only Gaussian Modeling
For a depth-only Gaussian model (without color information), the implementation simplifies:

1. **Opacity Initialization**:
    - The opacity is set to 1, indicating fully opaque Gaussians.

2. **Color Information**:
    - The color-related parameters and transformations can be ignored or removed. This focuses solely on the depth information during rasterization.

3. **Mathematical Definition**:
    - The depth-only Gaussian is defined by its 3D mean (\( \mu \)), 3D covariance (\( \Sigma \)), and opacity (\( o \)).

#### Summary
The depth projection and rasterization process involves transforming the 3D Gaussians into 2D space using camera extrinsics and intrinsics, approximating the 2D covariance from the 3D covariance, and compositing the Gaussians based on depth to form the final image. The Gaussian model is parameterized by its mean, covariance, and opacity, with color information optionally included. For depth-only modeling, the focus is on the opacity and 3D covariance to represent the depth accurately.

Here's a revised academic version of your method section, focusing on the model definition and depth generation process:


## Modeling
We propose a depth-only Gaussian splatting model for efficient 3D scene representation and depth map generation. Our model is defined as follows[@yeMathematicalSupplementTexttt2023]:

Let $\mathcal{G} = \{G_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of $N$ 3D Gaussians, where each Gaussian $G_i$ is parameterized by:

$$
G_i = (\boldsymbol{\mu}_i, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i, o_i)
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the 3D mean, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ is the 3D covariance matrix, and $o_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is the opacity. Initially, we set $o_i = 1$ for all Gaussians, indicating fully opaque Gaussians.

The 3D covariance $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i$ is parameterized by scale $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and rotation quaternion $\mathbf{q}_i \in \mathbb{R}^4$:

$$
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i = \mathbf{R}_i \mathbf{S}_i \mathbf{S}_i^T \mathbf{R}_i^T
$$

where $\mathbf{R}_i$ is the rotation matrix derived from $\mathbf{q}_i$, and $\mathbf{S}_i = \text{diag}(\exp(\mathbf{s}_i))$ is a diagonal scaling matrix.

To project the 3D Gaussians onto the 2D image plane, we use the following transformation:

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}'_i = \pi(\mathbf{P}\mathbf{T}_{cw}\tilde{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_i)
$$

where $\mathbf{T}_{cw} \in SE(3)$ is the camera-to-world transformation matrix, $\mathbf{P} \in \mathbb{R}^{4\times4}$ is the projection matrix, $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_i$ is the homogeneous coordinate of $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i$, and $\pi: \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is the perspective division and viewport transformation.

The 2D covariance $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}'_i$ of the projected Gaussian is approximated as:

$$
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}'_i = \mathbf{J}\mathbf{R}_{cw}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i\mathbf{R}_{cw}^T\mathbf{J}^T
$$

where $\mathbf{R}_{cw}$ is the rotation component of $\mathbf{T}_{cw}$, and $\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian of the projection:

$$
\mathbf{J} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{f_x}{t_z} & 0 & -\frac{f_x t_x}{t_z^2} \\
0 & \frac{f_y}{t_z} & -\frac{f_y t_y}{t_z^2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

with $f_x, f_y$ being the focal lengths and $(t_x, t_y, t_z)$ the translation component of $\mathbf{T}_{cw}$.

To generate the depth map, we employ a front-to-back compositing scheme. For each pixel $p$, we compute its depth value $d_p$ as:

$$
d_p = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i z_i
$$

where $z_i$ is the depth of the $i$-th Gaussian's mean, and $w_i$ is the weight computed as:

$$
w_i = o_i \exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}_p - \boldsymbol{\mu}'_i)^T (\boldsymbol{\Sigma}'_i)^{-1} (\mathbf{x}_p - \boldsymbol{\mu}'_i))
$$

Here, $\mathbf{x}_p$ is the 2D coordinate of pixel $p$.

This depth-only Gaussian splatting model allows for efficient representation of 3D scenes and generation of depth maps without the need for color information. The model parameters are optimized using gradient descent to minimize the difference between the generated depth maps and ground truth depth measurements.


Depth-only Gaussian splatting is an efficient method for representing 3D scenes and generating depth maps. In our approach, we initialize 3D Gaussians from a dense point cloud of the scene, captured by a depth camera.

Each 3D Gaussian is parameterized as follows:

$$G = (\mu, \Sigma, o)$$

where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the mean, $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ is the covariance matrix, and $o = 1$ is the opacity, set to 1 for all Gaussians to make them fully opaque.

The projection of a 3D Gaussian onto the 2D image plane is computed as:

$$\mu_I = \pi(P(T_{wc}\mu_{homogeneous}))$$

where $T_{wc} \in SE(3)$is the world-to-camera transformation, $P \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4}$ is the projection matrix, and $\pi: \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is the projection to pixel coordinates.

The 2D covariance $\Sigma_I$ of a projected Gaussian is:

$$\Sigma_I = JR_{wc}\Sigma R_{wc}^T J^T$$

where $R_{wc}$ is the rotation component of $T_{wc}$, and $J$ is the Jacobian of the projection.

To generate the depth map, we use a front-to-back compositing scheme. For each pixel $p$, we compute its depth value $d_p$ as:

$$d_p = \sum_i w_i z_i$$

where $z_i$ is the depth of the $i$-th Gaussian's mean, and $w_i$ is the weight computed based on the 2D Gaussian distribution:

$$w_i = \exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x_p - \mu_{I,i})^T \Sigma_{I,i}^{-1} (x_p - \mu_{I,i}))$$

Here, $x_p$ is the 2D coordinate of pixel $p$, $\mu_{I,i}$ and $\Sigma_{I,i}$ are the projected mean and covariance of the $i$-th Gaussian.

This approach allows for efficient depth map generation without the need for color information, leveraging the dense point cloud captured by the depth camera.


Depth-only Gaussian splatting is a highly effective method for modeling 3D scenes and producing depth maps. In our methodology, we initiate 3D Gaussians from a dense point cloud acquired via a depth camera. Each 3D Gaussian is defined as follows:
$$G = (\mu, \Sigma, o)$$
where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^3$ represents the mean, $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ denotes the covariance matrix, and $o = 1$ signifies the opacity, set uniformly to 1 for all Gaussians to ensure they are fully opaque.

The projection of a 3D Gaussian onto the 2D image plane is computed as:
$$\mu_I = \pi(P(T_{wc} \mu_{\text{homogeneous}}))$$
where $T_{wc} \in SE(3)$ denotes the world-to-camera transformation, $P \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4}$ represents the projection matrix, and $\pi: \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ maps to pixel coordinates.

The 2D covariance $\Sigma_I$ of a projected Gaussian is given by:
$$\Sigma_I = J R_{wc} \Sigma R_{wc}^T J^T$$
where $R_{wc}$ is the rotation component of $T_{wc}$, and $J$ denotes the Jacobian of the projection.

To generate the depth map, we employ a front-to-back compositing strategy. For each pixel $p$, its depth value $d_p$ is computed as:
$$d_p = \sum_i w_i z_i$$
where $z_i$ represents the depth of the $i$-th Gaussian's mean, and $w_i$ is the weight derived from the 2D Gaussian distribution:
$$w_i = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x_p - \mu_{I,i})^T \Sigma_{I,i}^{-1} (x_p - \mu_{I,i})\right)$$
Here, $x_p$ is the 2D coordinate of pixel $p$, $\mu_{I,i}$ and $\Sigma_{I,i}$ denote the projected mean and covariance of the $i$-th Gaussian.

This approach enables efficient depth map generation by leveraging the dense point cloud captured by the depth camera, without requiring colour information.

## Depth Reprojection 


Depth at a pixel $i$ is represented by combining contributions from multiple Gaussian elements, each associated with a certain depth and confidence. Depth $D_i$ can be expressed as[@kerbl3dGaussianSplatting2023]:
$$ 
D_i = \frac{\sum_{n \leq N} d_n \cdot c_n \cdot \alpha_n \cdot T_n}{\sum_{n \leq N} c_n \cdot \alpha_n \cdot T_n} 
$$
$d_n$ is the depth value from the $n$-th Gaussian, $c_n$ is the confidence or weight of the $n$-th Gaussian,$\alpha_n$ is the opacity calculated from Gaussian parameters, $T_n$ is the product of transparencies from all Gaussians in front of the $n$-th Gaussian.

The reprojection method utilizes the alignment of 2D Gaussian projections with observed depth data from an RGB-D camera. This involves adjusting the parameters of the Gaussians to minimize the discrepancy between the projected depth and the observed depth. The offset $\Delta_n$ and the covariance matrix $\Sigma'$ are crucial for calculating the Gaussian weights $\alpha_n$ and their impact on reprojection accuracy.

## Camera Tracking


We define the camera pose as

$$
 \mathbf{T}_{cw} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{R}_{cw} & \mathbf{t}_{cw} \\ \mathbf{0} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \in SE(3)
$$

where $\mathbf{T}_{cw}$ represents the camera-to-world transformation matrix. Notably, we parameterize the rotation $\mathbf{R}_{cw} \in SO(3)$ using a quaternion $\mathbf{q}_{cw}$. This choice of parameterization is motivated by several key advantages that quaternions offer in the context of camera pose estimation and optimization. 在四元数在表达旋转上相比纯粹的旋转矩阵会出现什么问题？

减少了优化的参数数量：Quaternions provide a compact and efficient representation, requiring only four parameters compared to the nine elements of a rotation matrix, which significantly reduces computational complexity. 
数值稳定性：Moreover, their inherent structure helps maintain numerical stability, as they are less susceptible to cumulative rounding errors and better preserve orthonormality over multiple operations. This robustness is particularly crucial in scenarios involving long sequences of transformations or iterative optimization procedures.

这里有点废话了：其中一个关键点是没有约束，不像旋转矩阵必须是正交的，我记等还能会避免万向锁？In the realm of pose optimization, quaternions present a continuous and non-redundant parameterization of rotations, which is highly advantageous for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Unlike rotation matrices, which are constrained by orthonormality conditions, quaternions allow for unconstrained optimization, simplifying the optimization landscape and reducing the risk of convergence to local minima. This property is especially beneficial in the context of bundle adjustment and pose graph optimization, where the ability to efficiently update and refine camera orientations is paramount. Furthermore, quaternions facilitate smooth and efficient interpolation between rotations, enabling techniques such as Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP), which can be invaluable in applications requiring camera motion smoothing or trajectory estimation.

然后引出我的优化变量设计，对规范化的四元数和姿态分别优化，
损失设计，对四元数和姿态优化的学习率是不一样的所以分开了，实验所得大约是5\*1e-4,和1e-3的学习率，
解释L1dpeth损失的定义，真实姿态下的深度图和估计姿态下面的重投影的深度图，注意重投影会提供一个能够重投影的掩码mask，代表是否被重投影，L1depth仅仅计算mask部分的深度图的损失

轮廓损失也是如此

The loss function is designed to ensure accurate depth estimations and edge alignment, incorporating both depth magnitude and contour accuracy. It can be defined as:
$$ 
L = \lambda_1 \cdot L_{\text{depth}} + \lambda_2 \cdot L_{\text{contour}} 
$$
where: $L_{\text{depth}} = \sum_i |D_i^{\text{predicted}} - D_i^{\text{observed}}|$ represents the L1 loss for depth accuracy, $L_{\text{contour}} = \sum_j |\nabla D_j^{\text{predicted}} - \nabla D_j^{\text{observed}}|$ focuses on the alignment of depth contours or edges, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are weights that balance the two parts of the loss function, tailored to the specific requirements of the application.

这里你要写一个最小化目标，并且我用的是adam优化器，解释优化方法，
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CameraConfig:
    trans_lr: float = 1e-3
    quat_lr: float = 5 * 1e-4
    quat_opt_reg: float = 1e-3
    trans_opt_reg: float = 1e-3
    def _create_optimizers(self) -> list[Optimizer]:
        params = [
            # name, value, lr
            # ("means3d", self.means3d, self.lr_means3d),
            ("quat", self.quaternion_cur, self.config.quat_lr),
            ("trans", self.translation_cur, self.config.trans_lr),
        ]
        optimizers = [
            Adam(
                [
                    {
                        "params": param,
                        "lr": lr,
                        "name": name,
                    }
                ],
                weight_decay=(
                    self.config.quat_opt_reg
                    if name == "quat"
                    else self.config.trans_opt_reg
                ),
            )
            for name, param, lr in params
        ]
        return optimizers
```
,并且我是定义了weight_decay，,这个你也要体现在优化目标中，总损失应该是定义了 一个正则项的
