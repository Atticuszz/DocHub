# Method

Depth-only In our methodology, we initiate 3D Gaussians from a dense point cloud acquired via a RGB-D camera.

## Pre-process






## Gaussian Splatting



Let $\mathcal{G} = \{G_i\}_{i=1}^N$ denote a set of $N$ 3D Gaussians. Each Gaussian $G_i$ is characterized by its 3D mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$, 3D covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$, and opacity $o_i \in \mathbb{R}$. We initialize these Gaussians from a point cloud, where each point corresponds to a Gaussian's mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i$.

For the initial parameterization, we set $o_i = 1$ for all Gaussians to ensure full opacity. The scale $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ of each Gaussian is initialized based on the local point density:

$$\mathbf{s}_i = \log(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}\sum_{j=1}^3 d_{ij}^2})$$

where $d_{ij}$ is the distance to the $j$-th nearest neighbour of point $i$. This approach ensures that the initial Gaussian sizes are proportional to the local point distribution.

To represent the orientation of each Gaussian, we use a rotation quaternion $\mathbf{q}_i \in \mathbb{R}^4$. Initially, we set $\mathbf{q}_i = (1, 0, 0, 0)$ for all Gaussians, corresponding to no rotation. The 3D covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i$ is then parameterized using $\mathbf{s}_i$ and $\mathbf{q}_i$:

$$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i = R(\mathbf{q}_i) S(\mathbf{s}_i) S(\mathbf{s}_i)^T R(\mathbf{q}_i)^T$$

where $R(\mathbf{q}_i)$ is the rotation matrix derived from $\mathbf{q}_i$, and $S(\mathbf{s}_i) = \text{diag}(\exp(\mathbf{s}_i))$ is a diagonal matrix of scales.

To project these 3D Gaussians onto a 2D image plane, we follow the approach described by [@kerbl3dGaussianSplatting2023]. The projection of the 3D mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i$ to the 2D image plane is given by:

$$\boldsymbol{\mu}_{I,i} = \pi(P(T_{wc} \boldsymbol{\mu}_{i,\text{homogeneous}}))$$

where $T_{wc} \in SE(3)$ is the world-to-camera transformation, $P \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4}$ is the projection matrix [@yeMathematicalSupplementTexttt2023], and $\pi: \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ maps to pixel coordinates.

The 2D covariance $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{I,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{2\times2}$ of the projected Gaussian is derived as:

$$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{I,i} = J R_{wc} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i R_{wc}^T J^T$$

where $R_{wc}$ represents the rotation component of $T_{wc}$, and $J$ is the affine transform as described by Zwicker et al. [@zwickerEWASplatting2002].


## Depth Compositing



For depth map generation, we employ a front-to-back compositing scheme, which allows for accurate depth estimation and edge alignment. Let $d_n$ represent the depth value associated with the $n$-th Gaussian, which is the z-coordinate of the Gaussian's mean in the camera coordinate system. The depth $D(p)$ at pixel $p$ is computed as [@kerbl3dGaussianSplatting2023]:

$$D(p) = \sum_{n \leq N} d_n \cdot \alpha_n \cdot T_n, \quad \text{where } T_n = \prod_{m<n} (1 - \alpha_m)$$

Here, $\alpha_n$ represents the opacity of the $n$-th Gaussian at pixel $p$, computed as:

$$\alpha_n = o_n \cdot \exp(-\sigma_n), \quad \sigma_n = \frac{1}{2} \Delta_n^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_I^{-1} \Delta_n$$

where $\Delta_n$ is the offset between the pixel center and the 2D Gaussian center $\boldsymbol{\mu}_I$, and $o_n$ is the opacity parameter of the Gaussian. $T_n$ denotes the cumulative transparency product of all Gaussians preceding $n$, accounting for the occlusion effects of previous Gaussians.

To ensure consistent representation across the image, we normalize the depth values. First, we calculate the total accumulated opacity $\alpha(p)$ for each pixel:

$$\alpha(p) = \sum_{n \leq N} \alpha_n \cdot T_n$$

The normalized depth $\text{Norm}_D(p)$ is then defined as:

$$\text{Norm}_D(p) = \frac{D(p)}{\alpha(p)}$$

This normalization process ensures that the depth values are properly scaled and comparable across different regions of the image, regardless of the varying densities of Gaussians in the scene. By projecting 3D Gaussians onto the 2D image plane and computing normalized depth values, we can effectively generate depth maps that accurately represent the 3D structure of the scene while maintaining consistency across different viewing conditions.

## Camera Pose



We define the camera pose as

$$
 \mathbf{T}_{cw} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{R}_{cw} & \mathbf{t}_{cw} \\ \mathbf{0} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \in SE(3)
$$

where $\mathbf{T}_{cw}$ represents the camera-to-world transformation matrix. Notably, we parameterize the rotation $\mathbf{R}_{cw} \in SO(3)$ using a quaternion $\mathbf{q}_{cw}$. This choice of parameterization is motivated by several key advantages that quaternions offer in the context of camera pose estimation and optimization. Quaternions provide a compact and efficient representation, requiring only four parameters, while maintaining numerical stability and avoiding singularities such as gimbal lock. Their continuous and non-redundant nature is particularly advantageous for gradient-based optimization algorithms, allowing for unconstrained optimization and simplifying the optimization landscape.

## Optimization
Based on these considerations, we design our optimization variables to separately optimize the normalized quaternion and the translation. The loss function is designed to ensure accurate depth estimations and edge alignment, incorporating both depth magnitude and contour accuracy. It can be defined as:

$$ 
L = \lambda_1 \cdot L_{\text{depth}} + \lambda_2 \cdot L_{\text{contour}} 
$$

where $L_{\text{depth}}$ represents the L1 loss for depth accuracy, and $L_{\text{contour}}$ focuses on the alignment of depth contours or edges. Specifically:

$$
L_{\text{depth}} = \sum_{i \in M} |D_i^{\text{predicted}} - D_i^{\text{observed}}|
$$

$$
L_{\text{contour}} = \sum_{j \in M} |\nabla D_j^{\text{predicted}} - \nabla D_j^{\text{observed}}|
$$

Here, $M$ denotes the reprojection mask, indicating which pixels are valid for reprojection. Both $L_{\text{depth}}$ and $L_{\text{contour}}$ are computed only over the masked regions. $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are weights that balance the two parts of the loss function, tailored to the specific requirements of the application.

The optimization objective can be formulated as:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{q}_{cw}, \mathbf{t}_{cw}} L + \lambda_q \|\mathbf{q}_{cw}\|_2^2 + \lambda_t \|\mathbf{t}_{cw}\|_2^2
$$

where $\lambda_q$ and $\lambda_t$ are regularization terms for the quaternion and translation parameters, respectively.

We employ the Adam optimizer for both quaternion and translation optimization, with different learning rates and weight decay values for each. The learning rates are set to $5 Ã— 10^-4$ for quaternion optimization and $10^-3$ for translation optimization, based on experimental results. The weight decay values are set to $10^-3$ for both quaternion and translation parameters, serving as regularization to prevent overfitting.
