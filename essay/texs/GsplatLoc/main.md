abstract: we introduce GSplatLoc, a high-precision pose optimization method for unposed RGB-D cameras, utilizing a volumetric representation based on 3D Gaussian reprojection. This novel approach is specifically tailored for RGB-D data, enabling ultra-precise pose estimation through the integration of existing 3D Gaussian volumes and actual depth maps captured from varying perspectives. By optimizing the current pose against these models, GSplatLoc achieves rotational errors close to zero and translational errors within 0.01mm. This significant enhancement in pose accuracy is a hundredfold improvement over existing point cloud alignment algorithms for RGB-D pose estimation. Extensive comparisons demonstrate that GSplatLoc not only refines the accuracy of pose estimation but also enhances the robustness and fidelity of real-time 3D scene reconstruction, setting a new standard for SLAM applications in robotics and augmented reality.

# Method

## reprojection 


Depth at a pixel $i$ is represented by combining contributions from multiple Gaussian elements, each associated with a certain depth and confidence. Depth $D_i$ can be expressed as[@kerbl3dGaussianSplatting2023]:
$$ 
D_i = \frac{\sum_{n \leq N} d_n \cdot c_n \cdot \alpha_n \cdot T_n}{\sum_{n \leq N} c_n \cdot \alpha_n \cdot T_n} 
$$
$d_n$ is the depth value from the $n$-th Gaussian, $c_n$ is the confidence or weight of the $n$-th Gaussian,$\alpha_n$ is the opacity calculated from Gaussian parameters, $T_n$ is the product of transparencies from all Gaussians in front of the $n$-th Gaussian.

The reprojection method utilizes the alignment of 2D Gaussian projections with observed depth data from an RGB-D camera. This involves adjusting the parameters of the Gaussians to minimize the discrepancy between the projected depth and the observed depth. The offset $\Delta_n$ and the covariance matrix $\Sigma'$ are crucial for calculating the Gaussian weights $\alpha_n$ and their impact on reprojection accuracy.


## loss



The loss function is designed to ensure accurate depth estimations and edge alignment, incorporating both depth magnitude and contour accuracy. It can be defined as:
$$ 
L = \lambda_1 \cdot L_{\text{depth}} + \lambda_2 \cdot L_{\text{contour}} 
$$
where: $L_{\text{depth}} = \sum_i |D_i^{\text{predicted}} - D_i^{\text{observed}}|$ represents the L1 loss for depth accuracy, $L_{\text{contour}} = \sum_j |\nabla D_j^{\text{predicted}} - \nabla D_j^{\text{observed}}|$ focuses on the alignment of depth contours or edges, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are weights that balance the two parts of the loss function, tailored to the specific requirements of the application.
