  abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient data structure, ikd-Tree, for dynamic space partition. The ikd-Tree incrementally updates a k-d tree with new coming points only, leading to much lower computation time than existing static k-d trees. Besides point-wise operations, the ikd-Tree supports several features such as box-wise operations and down-sampling that are practically useful in robotic applications. In parallel to the incremental operations (i.e., insert, re-insert, and delete), ikd-Tree actively monitors the tree structure and partially re-balances the tree, which enables efficient nearest point search in later stages. The ikd-Tree is carefully engineered and supports multi-thread parallel computing to maximize the overall efficiency. We validate the ikd-Tree in both theory and practical experiments. On theory level, a complete time complexity analysis is presented to prove the high efficiency. On experiment level, the ikd-Tree is tested on both randomized datasets and real-world LiDAR point data in LiDAR-inertial odometry and mapping application. In all tests, ikd-Tree consumes only 4\% of the running time in a static k-d tree.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Registration of point cloud data containing both depth and color information is critical for a variety of applications, including in‚Äêfield robotic plant manipulation, crop growth modeling, and autonomous navigation. However, current state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart registration methods often fail in challenging agricultural field conditions due to factors such as occlusions, plant density, and variable illumination. To address these issues, we propose the NDT‚Äê6D registration method, which is a color‚Äêbased variation of the Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) registration approach for point clouds. Our method computes correspondences between pointclouds using both geometric and color information and minimizes the distance between these correspondences using only the three‚Äêdimensional (3D) geometric dimensions. We evaluate the method using the GRAPES3D data set collected with a commercial‚Äêgrade RGB‚ÄêD sensor mounted on a mobile platform in a vineyard. Results show that registration methods that only rely on depth information fail to provide quality registration for the tested data set. The proposed color‚Äêbased variation outperforms state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart methods with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1‚Äì1.6\,cm for NDT‚Äê6D compared with 1.1‚Äì2.3\,cm for other color‚Äêinformation‚Äêbased methods and 1.2‚Äì13.7\,cm for noncolor‚Äêinformation‚Äêbased methods. The proposed method is shown to be robust against noises using the TUM RGBD data set by artificially adding noise present in an outdoor scenario. The relative pose error (RPE) increased 14\% for our method compared to an increase of 75\% for the best‚Äêperforming registration method. The obtained average accuracy suggests that the NDT‚Äê6D registration methods can be used for in‚Äêfield precision agriculture applications, for example, crop detection, size‚Äêbased maturity estimation, and growth modeling.},

  abstract = {Unmanned mining is one of the most effective methods to solve mine safety and low efficiency. However, it is the key to accurate localization and mapping for underground mining environment. A novel graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) optimization method is proposed, which is based on Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) three-dimensional (3D) point cloud registration between consecutive frames, between consecutive key frames and between loop frames, and is constrained by roadway plane and loop. GICP-based 3D point cloud registration between consecutive frames and consecutive key frames is first combined to optimize laser odometer constraints without other sensors such as inertial measurement unit (IMU). According to the characteristics of the roadway, the innovative extraction of the roadway plane as the node constraint of pose graph SLAM, in addition to automatic removing the noise point cloud to further improve the consistency of the underground roadway map. A lightweight and efficient loop detection and optimization based on rules and GICP is designed. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated in four scenes (such as the underground mine laboratory), and compared with the existing 3D laser SLAM method (such as Lidar Odometry and Mapping (LOAM)). The results show that the algorithm could realize low drift localization and point cloud map construction. This method provides technical support for localization and navigation of underground mining environment.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), i.e., the reconstruction of the environment represented by a (3D) map and the concurrent pose estimation, has made astonishing progress. Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment. Additionally, dense and accurate depth maps are generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, which we plan to use in the context of our project aiming on the automatic construction and site monitoring.},
